#### Line charts are bread and butter of visualization. Here we test out libraries and methods for making them.


##### Brief comments on each library:


* Vega - easy to get started, almost fully customizable.

* Vega-lite - very easy to generate basic charts, some limitations and difficulties when adding interactions such as hovering data points.

* Plotly and Plotly-json - simple usage, number of features.

* Chart.js - easy to get started but some limitations when working with CSV files. When added about 5k data entries it became significantly slow.

* Bokeh - very easy implementation, seems be more difficult to use on website than JS libraries.
